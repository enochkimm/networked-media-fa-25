  <h1 style="color:white;">The Next Day â€” 11/24/2017</h1>

  <p>I woke up, washed up, and immediately headed to my PC.</p>

  <p>It looked like I was locked out my Minecraft account and I forgot the password to it since it always auto logins</p>

  <p>So I requested a password reset email</p>

  <p>But for some reason I was also locked out of my email as well?</p>

  <p>2017 was a time when 2FA wasn't pushed hard like it is now, so I never bothered linking my phone number to any of my accounts</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>Yeah long story short I lost like all everything that was linked to my email. Good thing I didn't have a bank account yet because all the money would've been taken</p>
