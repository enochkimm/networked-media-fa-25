  <p>The 4 day "Thanksgiving" weekend had just started and I was playing Minecraft as usual.<br/>
     Ever since I got this new PC, my whole day consisted of me playing on multiplayer servers.</br>
    </p>

  <p>I recall always knowing that the multiplayer community was toxic.<br/>
     Players frequently typed slurs, YouTubers often exposed for crimes, the list goes on.</br>
    However I never really thought much of it.</p>

  <p>I was in a Discord server, when a player sent a screenshot of a rare item they obtained.<br/>
    That item aside, I thought the texture pack he was using was very cool. <br/>
    So I sent him a DM asking which one hes using.</p>

  <p>We had a short <a href="conversation.html">conversation.</a></p>
