  <p>I didn't understand what was going on at all, so I started searching on Google</p>

  <p>After about an hour of researching and convincing myself that I was, in fact, dumb, I finally reached the conclusions that I got ratted</p>

  <p>RATs (Remote Access Trojan) are essentially a malware that allows a person to take control of your PC</p>

  <p>So, what did I do?</br>
    I downloaded a AntiVirus (don't buy these, these are scams) and tried removing it</p>

  <p>It didn't do anything</p>

  <p>So after another hour of research and randomly clicking in my Settings, I found my fix</p>

  <p>I booted into Safe Mode, then ran a full scan with Windows Defender.  
  Defender found a couple of suspicious files, quarantined them, and suggested a cleanup.</p>

  <p>I removed the quarantined files, cleared temporary folders, and then booted normally. I changed passwords for my email and game accounts, and enabled two-factor authentication where possible. It was really tedious, but eventually things returned to normal.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>What did I learn?</br>
    First and foremos donâ€™t run random .exe files. When it comes to file handling, do everything the "vanilla" way. Oh and also don't buy antiviruses</p>
